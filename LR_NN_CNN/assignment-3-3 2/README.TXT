THIS INCLUDES THE 
The main.py is the entry to the whole program, after input correct options you can run the three files: 1 for LogRegression.py, 2 for main.py itself and 3 for tf-cnn.py.

For implementation:

Regression is in LogRegression.py
Single-hidden-layer NN is in main.py
CNN is in tf-cnn.py.

Numpy, Tensorflow and PIL library are required. For all other things I implement by myself.

Thank you very much! :)
